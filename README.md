# Why I donated, and how I did it

TL;DR: LOL has pledged the first month of mining, plus 25% of new mining for first 1,000 days.

## The Opportunity
I want to be part of a community that is energized by the enormity of the opportunity and challenge of creating a truly useful and neutral smart contract platform. 

With smart contracts we have the historical opportunity of giving informal communities formal properties.

To be a part of that future, we need to stay in the game. It's a long game.

## The Problem

The sustainability depends on excellence of execution on a few domains: social, technological, and entrepreneurial.

A blockchain network's sustainability is challenged uniquely by the "free rider problem": if one can beneficially participate in a community without giving back, then that is the rational choice, and that is the expected outcome. 

Mining is not the only activity of a community. Although by definition as miners we are doing "work", we are also free-riders on those that perform the remainder of the activities. If operating nodes is the only way to produce credits within a community, how does the remainder of the work get done? 

Networks try to solve this by binding contributions to rewards. But in certain conditions, and certain jurisdictions, not all viable designs can be safely implemented. In that circumstance communities need to rely on social consensus to combat the free rider problem: moral obligation and social norms.

I recognize that I am a free rider on work of current and future generations of 0L participants. To do my part to combat the problem, at the genesis of "experimental-network"  I've pledged to donate to causes and programs that ensure the survival of the network. 

**My pledge is simple. I'm giving 25% of my mining to different programs; a subscription fee for network survival.**

Today, I'm making good on my pledge, and documenting how I did it.

Besides this pledge, in February I also donated my "first month of mining": and that is documented publicly here: (link). In that case I gave away 100% of my 1st month of my rewards. At the time the maturity of the 0L  tooling did not allow me to execute the ongoing 25% donation. 

So as of June 14th 2021, **I've donated 41% of my mining rewards to different ecosystem participants**. Your situation and number may be different.

## Here's how I think about my pledge 

I think a network's survivability depends on a few key activities: 

- intense engineering effort,
- risk taking from exceptional entrepreneurs,
- honoring the shoulders we stand on, 
- a guarantee on doing good.

The first two should be obvious, no big technology project happens without dedicated teams working intensely with no guarantees while wrestling quietly with the risk of financial, personal, legal ruin.

Also it should be obvious we stand on the shoulders of a century of research, in computer science, economics, sociology, and cryptography. This work, past and future, needs to be honored if we are to draw from it meaningfully. 

And lastly, I think there should be a guarantee on the amount of good we can do in the world, a floor which is not zero or negative. Otherwise, why bother?

I'll be excited to participate in communities that think in this way. I lose interest in those that don't.  And when in doubt, in a fork for example, I will always join the community that walks that walk.

## Conflicts
The network has less value if there is obvious Sybil activity going on.

Yes, you could have a bigger share of a pie by creating more network nodes. But this degrades trust within the community. And as such the tools of the community are automatically worth less the instant you did that. Don't sybil.

By extension, I think doing self-serving donations that are outsized and unjustified, are just a form of sybil, and degrades trust in the network. 

## My Situation
My role is unique, and my donations will be scrutinized. Below I go at length through my rationale in an attempt to provide more trust in the process.

I'm a beneficiary of certain programs, and I'm also a miner.

I could simply choose to not donate to programs that I may be a beneficiary of. But there's a risk in signalling something altogether different than what I actually think a network needs. This could do more harm than good (and it wouldn't automatically confer more trust in me).

I've attempted in good faith to donate based on what I think is the correct configuration of donations, as though I were not laboring in this network. 

So, it is inevitable that some of my donations will be self-serving. And I want to highlight those. I benefit from these programs: Tip Jar, Fulltime Engineering, Moonshots (nominally, see more below).

**I only operate one node entirely for my benefit.**

My company LOL llc is in the business of operating nodes, and does operate nodes for two other groups, and one private individual. In the future we hope to host more. Of those two organization nodes: The 2019 OL Contributors, and Former Employees of Wireline Inc, I or my company may one day be a beneficiary, if those groups choose to donate to me.

Lastly, I'll declare here that I have no hidden Sybils. And I'm excited to be part of a network where the stewards have no hidden Sybils.

## My Choices

With that out of the way. Here's what I chose, giving particular attention to potential conflicts of interest.

#### Engineering:

This is obvious. What I like about this program is that it targets long term thinking for engineers that can contribute part-time based on deliverables.

Disclosure: I am a beneficiary of this.

#### Full Time Engineering:

What I like about this is that it solves a persistent problem which is getting engineers to be fully dedicated and undistracted.

Disclosure: I am a beneficiary of this.

####  Red Cross:

They have incredibly forward looking innovations and interventions going on today that leverage the technologies we work on.

#### Good list:

We can distribute ownership more broadly to communities doing good. There are many organizations that would benefit from being stakeholders now or in the future, and this is a way to introduce them with no risk. Plus if I make any meaningful money from this project I believe I will have a moral obligation to the inequality that this contributed to.

#### App Studio:

Without economic value created, credits/coins/assets on a network have no value. Until there are apps we are engaging in a sophisticated exercise in redistribution of nothing. 

Entrepreneurs create economic value. The app studio is the locomotive.

#### Moonshots:

Without risk-taking from spectacularly talented minds, any platform just falls from orbit. Performing maintenance is insufficient to be excellent. How do you get the best minds laser focused on speculative projects? Oversized payments for moonshots.

Disclosure: While my company LOL  is currently a nominal beneficiary of an administrative fee of this program, this will soon not be the case.  LOL's priority is to transfer this program to another administrator. As such an administrative fee exists to future-proof this program, such that we can find a more capable and professional steward.

#### Deep Tech:

I see this as a way of honoring the people that quietly drive progress in technology; academics. All products exist from some kind of a breakthrough in academia. And academics generally do not have a share in the wealth their creations make. Honoring previous work, and ensuring equitable distribution to future researchers is the correct thing to do and as a bonus will attract the best minds to our community.

#### Tip Jar:

This choice probably deserves the most scrutiny. Yes I donate to the tip-jar, and it wasn't an obvious choice given my privileged voice in the community. I decided to do so because of the semantics, more so than to recapture a reward.

To be able to make this decision I tried to depersonalize it: what if I had another person who had carried the weight of the project instead of me, so I could have kept a day job? How available is an entrepreneur that actually went through real professional and financial hardship and worked for two years with few weekends off to have this kind of impact? Is the one mining node sufficient inducement for those people? 

Most importantly, what does it say about the network that it has such a tip-jar? Given a choice of participating in a network that has this feature, and one that doesn't, I would be excited to be a part of a network that honored that kind of contribution.

Social Experiments. This is less obvious. This is special because it's by RadicalxChange. They have managed to create an unlikely movement collecting elite thinkers puzzling away at creating better decentralized games for society. The designs that will emerge from here will become patterns and templates. That is, for the types of social transformation that we expect from smart contracts, the mechanisms are yet to be invented, and it wouldn't surprise me if they came from people in the RxC network.

####  Human rewards:

I think this is part of the democratizing of access to 0L. Many projects have had faucets of some kind that allow non-technical people to become stakeholders. The Human Protocol, and associated companies have created the best in class decentralized proof-of-human technology. Their technology pays for puzzle solving (using reverse turing tests), a type of paid machine learning training. This coupled with a fund for a faucet could greatly amplify the reach of 0L outside of an elite technology community.

## Here are the steps I took to execute my pledge.

TL;DR: there are two "autopay" configuration files involved, and they were submitted in this order.

- autopay_batch.json - which is the definitive ongoing 25% donation of new incoming mining rewards.
- back.autopay_batch.json - applies a 25% of current balance, in effort to backdate the 25% of mining income pledge.

Steps:

- Fill out autopay_batch.json and place in ~/.0L
- Create the backdated file with `onboard fix --account`
- Submit the backdated tx with `txs autopay-batch -f ~/.0L/back.autopay_batch.json`
- Submit the ongoing donations  tx with `txs autopay-batch -f ~/.0L/autopay_batch.json`

## Configuring the files

I needed to create a file for future donations, and another for the backdating.

Started with future donations:  "autopay_batch.json". Having that, I can use the  `onboard fix --account`  tool to create the equivalent instructions in backdated format. The file `back.autopay_batch.json` gets created. Now I'll have:

- ~/.0L/autopay_batch.json 
- ~/.0L/back.autopay_batch.json

```

## Submitting the TX

You'll send two batches of transactions, one from each file:

> txs autopay-batch -f ~/.0L/back.autopay_batch.json 
> txs autopay-batch -f ~/.0L/autopay_batch.json 


#### What happened next:

The backdated donations ran once on the following epoch after the transaction. It debited 25% of the existing balance. Then the instructions were no longer needed.
The ongoing donations did nothing on the first epoch (technically 25% of 0 new balance), and in subsequent epochs did 25% of new incoming balance.


# Reference: Donating first month of mining

For reference, and historical purposes. Here's the first donation I made. Sending one whole month's rewards.

While the file formats have changed in the months since. This would be an equivalent way of executing that transaction:

Note, that not all programs existed at the time I did the transaction, e.g. Fulltime Engineering, and A Good List.
